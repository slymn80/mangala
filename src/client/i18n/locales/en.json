    "rule6": "6. Players distribute their 24 stones, placing 4 in each pit.",
    "rule7": "7. The 6 small pits in front of each player are their zone. The 6 pits opposite belong to the opponent.",

    "rule13": "13. If the last stone lands in their treasure, the player gets another turn.",
    "rule14": "14. Following the same rules, they play again. If a pit has only one stone, it can be moved to the next pit. The rule of placing in the starting pit doesn't apply when there's only one stone.",

    "rule16": "16. The same rules apply to the opponent.",

    "rule18": "18. If the last stone makes an even number (2, 4, 6, 8, etc.) in the opponent's pit, the player captures all stones in that pit and places them in their treasure. The turn passes.",
    "rule19": "19. If the last stone lands in an empty pit in the player's own zone, and the opposite pit has opponent's stones, the player captures both the opposite stones and their own stone, placing them all in their treasure. The turn passes.",

    "rule21": "21. The player whose zone emptied first also wins all remaining stones in the opponent's zone and places them in their treasure.",
    "rule22": "22. Mangala is played in 5 sets.",
    "rule23": "23. The winning player gets (1) point, the loser gets (0) points, and players in a draw each get half (0.5) points."
